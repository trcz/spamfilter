# spamfilter
Spam filtering algorithm using python scikit

**Dataset source:** http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/lingspam_public.tar.gz  
I've sampled 962 mails, spam:ham ratio is 1:1  
About 66% (644) mails are training set, the rest (314) will be used for testing  
I've preprocessed data manually   
Mails directories are in .rar due to upload limits  
  
**To-do list:**  
[-] automatize preprocessing  
[+] import mails' bodies  
[+] create feature matrix for training  
[-] create MultinomialNB model  
[-] test the algorithm
